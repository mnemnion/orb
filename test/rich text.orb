** literal

  We'll lead with [[a link][http://example.com]], since we can already
parse those. I'm going to add a =literal block=, and a ==double literal
block with newline==, and take it from there.


*** more literal

Now let's have a ===triple literal block===, and now, let's
go for a ==double literal = with equals==.


** bold

Time to add *bold*, ***multi-bold***, and **bold * with* intermediate**.

This is **bold /with italic/, which is pretty cool**. Yay!

Although it also doesn't work yet. boo.


** italic

This has /italic/, //double italic//, ///italic with // internal///,
and //italic wit __ markdown internal//.


** interpolated

This has `interpolated stuff`.  We don't do anything with this
yet but it will be important soon. ``this is double interpolated``.


** link

[[A simple link][httk://]] [[http://a.singlelink.com]]
