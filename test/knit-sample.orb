* Knitting sample


  This is a sample document to test the [[new knitter][@br/orb/knit/newknit]].

Here's an ordinary codeblock:

#!lua
local Sample = {}
#/lua


*** Named code block

Here's a /named/ codeblock:

#!lua @hello
print "Hello Lua!"
#/lua


*** #asLua SQL code block

This should be turned into a Lua string by the Lua parser.

#!sql @create-project #asLua
CREATE TABLE project (
   project_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   name TEXT
);
#/sql
