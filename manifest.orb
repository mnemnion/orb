* Manifest


This is the #Manifest file for the Orb project.

It is the first of its kind.


#!toml #manifest
contents = true

[ref]

# markdown_dir = "bom/diddy/bom/bom/"

[ref.domains]

random = "https://example.com/random/"
#/toml

let's add a codeblock of the wrong kind with the right tag:

#!peg #manifest
aaa <- "a"+
#/peg
