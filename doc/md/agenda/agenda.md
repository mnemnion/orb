# orb agenda


Orb is broadly similar to ``org-mode`` where tasks are concerned, the
[distinctions](hts://~/notes/orb.orb) being described in their own place.


``orb agenda``, then, gathers the agenda from the ``pwd`` level of the command.


From within ``femto`` we intend this to be ``!orb agenda``.


This will be powered by the [tag engine](hts://~/Orbit/hashtag.orb), which
is rapidly rising to the surface of my attention.
