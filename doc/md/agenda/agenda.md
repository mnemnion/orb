# orb agenda


Orb is broadly similar to `org-mode` where tasks are concerned, the
\[\[distinctions\]\[hts://~/notes/orb\.orb\]\] being described in their own place\.

`orb agenda`, then, gathers the agenda from the `pwd` level of the command\.

From within `femto` we intend this to be `!orb agenda`\.

This will be powered by the [tag engine](hts://~/Orbit/hashtag.orb), which
is rapidly rising to the surface of my attention\.
