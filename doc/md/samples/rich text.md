## literal

  We'll lead with [a link](http://example.com), since we can already
parse those. I'm going to add a `````literal block`````, and a `````double literal
block with newline`````, and take it from there. 


### more literal

Now let's have a `````triple literal block`````, and now, let's
go for a ````` double literal = with equals `````.


## bold

Time to add **bold**, **multi-bold**, and **bold \* with\* intermediate**.


This is **bold /with italic/, which is pretty cool**. Yay!


Although it also doesn't work yet. boo. 


## italic

This has _italic_, _double italic_, _italic with // internal_,
and _italic wit \_\_ markdown internal_. 


## interpolated

This has interpolated stuff.  We don't do anything with this
yet but it will be important soon. this is double interpolated.
