## literal

  We'll lead with [a link](http://example.com), since we can already
parse those. I'm going to add a ``literal block``, and a ``double literal
block with newline``, and take it from there. 


### more literal

Now let's have a ``triple literal block``, and now, let's
go for a `` double literal = with equals ``.


## bold

Time to add **bold**, **multi-bold**, and **bold \* with\* intermediate**.


This is **bold /with italic/, which is pretty cool**. Yay!


Although it also doesn't work yet. boo. 


## italic

This has _italic_, _double italic_, _italic with // internal_,
and _italic wit \_\_ markdown internal_. 


## interpolated

This has interpolated stuff.  We don't do anything with this
yet but it will be important soon. this is double interpolated. 


## link

[A simple link](httk://) [[http://a.singlelink.com]]
