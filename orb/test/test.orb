* Test

#Deprecated

I'm leaving this in because a =br orb test= verb is maybe a
good thing to have? I have this large collection of test files
which I'm manually exercising at the REPL, and this is a case
where the sessions approach is likely to be brittle relative to
what I could achieve with a custom test harness.


*** Original, now obsolete, discussion

=test= is an Orb verb which runs tests.

They are performed in this order: first =check= is executed for each
instantiated class which has it (this entails running the code) and
then, =session= is run using =femto=.  This entails running the code a
second time.

For ease of use, each project with =check=ed classes should have a =/check/=
directory, containing the entry point =/check/check.orb=.

This needs to setup and execute all checks on the class, and then print a
report.

Things like level of detail are setup in building the =check= instance.

After this, presuming no red flags (which short-circuits out to the command
line with ==os.exit(n)== where =n= is the number of failures), we run
=session=.

=session= is unwritten but it is a series of named call-and-response tests
executed at the REPL; each =session= preserves no state, which given our
strict state management can be accomplished by putting each session in its own
=_G=.

We can think of =check= as the unit tests and =session= as the integration
tests, I suppose.  I prefer to think of them as two ways of composing
invariants of the system, complementary in purpose and devastating in their
effect: namely, preventing bugs from creeping back in during refactorings of
various and sundry sorts.
