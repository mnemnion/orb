* Concordance

  This contains the SQLite for a *concordance*, which is in essence the
co-product of a =Doc=.

This describes two distinct =SQLite= databases, one held in common throughout
=bridge= and another which is personal and depends on the documents on the
computer in question.

These are merged and queried in common, so the schema are interleaved.  The
basic distinction is that =table= is in =bridge.cyclopedia=, and =table_in=
is in =bridge.concordance=.


** SQL for concordance

This file is being handled specially since we lack both transclusion and a way
to handle non-Lua languages in the =knit= phase.

The luajit script to translate this to [[concordance.orb]
[~/concordance/concordance]]
is found at [[sql-strip.lua]
[~~/etc/sql-strip.lua]].

*** codepoint

This decribes an =ortho= codepoint in =utf= space.

Since this descends from Unicode and will stay compatible with that,
it defines a version, so a given codepoint is not unique except within a
version.

Orb documents will be in =utf=, no exceptions, but =ggg= is in =Latin-1=
encoding, which is quite different.

#!lua
local create_codepoint = [[
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS codepoint (
   codepoint_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   codevalue NOT NULL,
   utf INTEGER default 1,
   category STRING NOT NULL DEFAULT 'utf',
   version STRING NOT NULL DEFAULT 'official',
   destription STRING NOT NULL,
);
]]
#/lua

- Schema fields :

   - codepoint_id :  Primary key for codepoint.
                     Note that this includes more code schemes than just
                     =utf=, we intend to represent e.g. =EBCDIC= and =Latin-1.

   - codevalue    :  Exact numeric value of a given codepoint.

   - utf          :  Boolean identifying a codepoint as =utf= or otherwise.

   - category     :  This is the actual codepoint category and =utf= is the
                     default.

   - version      :  Some schema come with versions, many do not. Example, the
                     code for 'a' in ASCII/utf will never change, so that
                     version is 'official'.

   - description  :  Somewhat of a misnomer, this is a unique string that
                     defines the codepoint.  In =utf= an example would be
                     «∞ INFINITY utf: U+221E, utf: E2 88 9E». ¶
                     Note the use of double guillemets: «»,
                     they are required. ¶
                     Latin-1 would say something like
                     «¬ NOT SIGN Latin-1: etc» but the not sign and
                     description would all be Latin-1, not =utf=.¶
