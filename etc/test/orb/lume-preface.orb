* Lume


This means, in brief:

-  Has  : an =/orb= folder, which contains subdirectories with =.orb= files and
   no cycles.

-  Has a =/src= folder, which contains, or will contain, sorcery files, which
   have the extension of the target language: =.lua= for most bridge projects,
   in principle, anything is supported.

-  Has a =/doc/md= folder, which will contain markdown weaves of the source
   files.

Aspirationally, it will handle any sort of project which has orb files to work
on, and will have a more refined mode for working on single files as well,
or single subdirectories of a project.

We may build an "overwatch" mode, which assumes all subdirectories might be
codex-normal, and sets up a lume for each, but this will live elsewhere.
