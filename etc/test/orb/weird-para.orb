** Introduction

This module is in a very real sense a *duet*.

It is an adaptation, refinement, extension, of Phillipe Janda's work,
 ,r[[luaepnf][http://siffiejoe.github.io/lua-luaepnf/]].

While =helm= was built from a repl provided by Tim Caswell in =luv=, that is a
case of taking a sketch and painting a picture.

Many difficult aspects of this algorithm are found directly in the source
material upon which this is based.

Don Phillipe has my thanks, and my fervent hope that he enjoys what follows.
