* Footnotes


  This is a *paragraph* with a footnote[{fn:1}].  It has
more than one line of text, and an [[obelus link]†]

[{fn:1}]: This will look like an obelus block until I write
          the part of the =Doc= grammar which identifies it as
          [[something else][@ref:tosomething/else]].

A final paragraph /with a bit of markup/.
