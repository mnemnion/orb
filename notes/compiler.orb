* Compiler


I decided awhile back that the best format for storing libraries and
applications is as a SQLite database full of blobs and metadata.

Dependencies in =bridgetools= are getting out of control, so it's time to
actually make this happen.

The actual process of compiling is admirably straightforward; we =load= a
string, giving it a name, and then use =string.dump= to create bytecode of it.

Another invocation of =load= turns this back into a function, which we
execute.  Simple as that.

Here I intend to design the database table structure, and continue to flesh
out the full system, while hopefully avoiding my lamentable tendency to
overspecify.


**** a note on pronunciation

  Foreign keys, e.g. =project_id=, are pronounced "project id", not "project
ID".  "id" as in "id est", to be crystal clear.


** SQLite table CREATEs


*** code

  The =code= table has a key =code_id=, a =blob= field =binary=, and a
=hash= field.  I think the =hash= field should be SHA3, just as a
best-practices sort of thing. As it turns out, after running a test, SHA512
is substantially faster.  Now, this may or may not be true of SHA512 in pure
LuaJIT, but that's less important.

So we want to open/create with:

#!sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS code (
   code_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   hash TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING,
   binary BLOB NOT NULL
);
#/sql

strictly speaking =blob= should also be UNIQUE but that's comparatively
expensive to check and guaranteed by the hash.


*** version

This implements the =bridge= house dialect of semantic versioning, as
described in original 2015 [[design documents][httk://]].

#!sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS version (
   version_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   edition STRING DEFAULT 'SNAPSHOT',
   major INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
   minor INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
   patch STRING DEFAULT '0',
   project INTEGER,
   FOREIGN KEY (project)
      REFERENCES project (project_id)
);
#/sql

=edition=, =major=, and =minor=, are all straightforward; worth explaining
that patches can follow several not-completely-numeric conventions and are
thus type-hinted as =STRING=.


*** project

This table describes projects.

Our =require= will, at first, just add a function to =package.loader=.
Additionally we'll use some sort of manifest to resolve dependencies,
but that comes later.

I /think/ the best way to separate fully-qualified from relative module names
is like so: =modname/submod=, =fully.qualified.project:modname/submod=.

Any =fully.qualified.project= needs to be *globally* unique across all bridge
projects.  There has never in the history of ever been a good way to do this.
Having project manifests at least keeps this from leaking into codebases.

Note that we're just going to split on =:=, there's no expectation that either
side is formatted in any special way.  Any "valid utf8" except let's be real,
I'm not even going to sanitize your string...

#!sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS project (
   project_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   name STRING UNIQUE NOT NULL ON CONFLICT IGNORE,
   repo STRING,
   repo_type STRING DEFAULT 'git',
   repo_alternates STRING,
   home STRING,
   website STRING
);
#/sql

This is a simple table. The =name= field is most important and must be unique,
as we've indicated, globally unique. =repo=, =home=, and =website= are all
URIs; I think =repo= and =website= are fairly self-explanatory.

=home= is intended to serve content, probably in JSON format, which can be
placed into a =codex= without having to compile a repo.  This will be added
(much) later.

On second thought, EDN should be our preferred interchange format, for all
the usual, excellent reasons.  Serving JSON is also necessary as a
compatibility layer.

=repo_alternates= is just what it says: if the main repo isn't available for
any reason, this is a list of URIs which can be checked for the repo.  Format
is a vector: =[repo1 repo2 repo3, repo4]=.

This scheme isn't 100% satisfactory, since =repo= can be =NULL=, but
=repo_type= would be =git= anyway. I think that's fine in practice.

*** module

  The =modules= table has all the metadata about a given blob. Let's mock it
up first.

#!sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS module (
   module_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   time DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   snapshot INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
   name STRING NOT NULL,
   type STRING DEFAULT 'luaJIT-2.1-bytecode',
   branch STRING,
   vc_hash STRING,
   project INTEGER NOT NULL,
   code INTEGER,
   version INTEGER NOT NULL,
   FOREIGN KEY (version)
      REFERENCES version (version_id)
   FOREIGN KEY (project)
      REFERENCES project (project_id)
      ON DELETE RESTRICT
   FOREIGN KEY (code)
      REFERENCES code (code_id)
);
#/sql

Most of this is self-describing. =snapshot= is a boolean, if false this is a
versioned module.  We'll be adding that later, so everything is configured so
that by default we have a snapshot.

=name= is the string used to =require= the module, stripped of any project
header.  =name= is not unique except when combined with a =project=, which
is.

=type= is for future compatibility. Eventually we'll want to store C shared
libraries in the codex, and Orb is in principle language-agnostic, so there's
no natural limit to what types we might have.

=branch= and =vc_hash= are optional fields for version-control purposes.
Optional because release software doesn't need them.  It's called =vc_hash=
because =commit= is a reserved word in SQL.

=version= is the foreign key to the =version= table, which uses Clu-style
semantic versioning. #todo add link

=project= is the foreign key to the =project= table, described next.

We don't want to delete any projects which still have modules, so we use
=ON DELETE RESTRICT= to prevent this from succeeding.

=code= is the foreign key for the actual binary blob and its hash.

Not sure whether to de-normalize the hash, and since I'm not sure, we won't
for now.  It doesn't seem necessary since we'll =JOIN= against the =code=
table in all cases.

It might be useful to add at least the hash of the source Orb file, I'm
trying to stay focused for now. #todo add hash of source file and migrate.


*** INSERTs

Various commands to insert data.


**** new project

#!sql
INSERT INTO project (name, repo, home, website)
VALUES (:name, :repo, :home, :website);
#/sql


**** new version

Will start with a stub since we're only creating snapshots for now.

#!sql
INSERT INTO version (edition)
VALUES (:edition);
#/sql


**** new code

Since we have a unique hash constraint it should be cheapest (and clearest)
to just try to write all codes then retrieve their primary keys by hash to
write to the module revision.

#!sql
INSERT INTO code (hash, binary)
VALUES (:hash, :binary);
#/sql


**** add module

  Note that many versions of a module may refer to the same code, and each
module must be a part of a project.

#!sql
INSERT INTO module (snapshot, version, name,
                    branch, vc_hash, project, code)
VALUES (:snapshot, :version, :name, :branch,
        :vc_hash, :project, :code);
#/sql


*** SELECTS

  Note that CASTing as REAL saves various complications on the LuaJIT side of
the equation.  53 bytes should suffice for a good long time.


**** get snapshot version

We only have one "SNAPSHOT" so let's retrieve that until we actually start
making proper versions:

#!sql
SELECT CAST (version.version_id AS REAL) FROM version
WHERE version.edition = 'SNAPSHOT';
#/sql


**** get project_id

#!sql
SELECT (CAST project.project_id AS REAL) FROM project
WHERE project.name = %s;
#/sql


**** get code_id by hash

#!sql
SELECT (CAST code.code_id AS REAL) FROM code
WHERE code.hash = %s;
#/sql


**** get latest module code_id

The better way to do this is with a join against the code table, but let's
get things working first.

#!sql
SELECT CAST (module.code_id AS REAL) FROM module
WHERE module.project = %d
   AND module.name = %s
ORDER BY module.time DESC LIMIT 1;
#/sql


**** get bare module code_id and project_id

If we don't have a project name, let's try and load just from the bare module.

This time, let's get all the =code_ids=, ordered by date, and the
=project_ids= as well, so we can iterate through and see if we have more than
one project with the same module name, so we can attach a warning to
=package=.

#!sql
SELECT CAST (module.code AS REAL),
       CAST (module.project AS REAL)
FROM module
WHERE module.name = %s
ORDER BY module.time DESC;
#/sql


**** get latest module bytecode

#!sql
SELECT code.binary FROM code
WHERE code.code_id = %d ;
#/sql

** Future

  This is an initial and (almost) minimal specification of what will
eventually be the =codex= format.  One thing Orb is trying to do better, is
that there is always a bunch of metadata associated with codebases, and no
obvious place to store it.  We're compelled to think of code as a
pile-of-files, and this breaks down badly when we're doing literate
programming.

Nor do I just want to recreate version control, badly. At various points in
this journey I wanted to use fossil-scm as a library, and I still think that's
about the best way to do things, but it's not practical for now, given the
resources I have available.

I currently have a split between fossil and git repos, and I'd like to
continue using =fossil=.  This would require a =libfossil=, which I doubt I'll
have the time to write personally but I can direct any curious and interested
parties at an incomplete and out of date version of this library.

What /is/ practical is to solve my case of dependency hell, and get to where
I can use my REPL on any of my projects without everything breaking.

After I do that, we want a native HTML representation of Orb files, and a
simple server for it.

Then we start breaking the most serious current limitation of Orb: it's
basically a fancy comment system, from Lua's perspective.  The load-and-dump
scheme does strip all the extraneous whitespace and keep the line numbers,
but we do want source mapping, which generalizes better.

Those source maps should of course be stored in the codex.

One leap at a time.
